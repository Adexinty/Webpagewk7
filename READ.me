🎨 Tech Company Roles with Multi-Theme Toggle
This is a responsive and animated web interface showcasing various tech company roles using interactive cards. Users can dynamically switch between multiple theme colors using a dropdown menu. The site is fully built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — using external files for structure, styling, and behavior.

🚀 Features
🃏 Animated Role Cards (Bounce, Pulse, and Grow effects)

🎨 Theme Switcher (Light, Dark, Yellow, Gray)

💾 Theme Persistence via localStorage

🧩 Clean separation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

🖥️ Fully responsive design

📁 File Structure

│
├── index.html        # HTML structure
├── index.css         # Styling for layout, themes, and animations
└── script.js         # Theme switch logic and animations
📷 Preview

(Replace with an actual screenshot if available)

🛠️ How to Run
Clone the repository or download the files.

Open index.html in a browser
No server needed — it's a static site.

Change the theme using the dropdown menu below the cards.

🧠 How It Works
Each card has animation on hover (bounce + glowing border).

Clicking a card triggers a scale/fade animation.

The selected theme is saved to localStorage, so it persists on reload.

Themes are applied by switching class on the <body> element.

📌 Technologies Used
HTML5

CSS3 (including @keyframes animations)

Vanilla JavaScript

Pull requests are welcome! Feel free to improve animations, add new themes, or refactor the JavaScript.
